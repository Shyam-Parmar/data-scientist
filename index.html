                <h5 class="mb-3">Overview</h5>
                <p class="mt-20">My passion lies at the intersection of business, data, and technology. I am currently an MS in Business Analytics and Information Systems student at the University of South Florida - MUMA College of Business where I am developing my skills as a data analyst/scientist through courses and projects related to machine learning and data visualizations.<br /><br />
                    I developed an analytical mindset and strong problem-solving skills during my Bachelor's program at the University of South Florida. I grew a passion for analytics when I first took my Statistics class for which I now use that knowledge in my data analytics, science, and machine learning projects.<br /><br />
                    In my free time, I tend to look at different statistics and trends of various datasets to practice and, expand my knowledge. I also enjoy learning about new data models and data science concepts in my free time. After graduating with my MS in BAIS program, I am looking to begin running as a data scientist or analyst.</p>

                        <p>As part of my project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 pandemic data using SQL Server Management Studios. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of SQL Server, I was able to obtain valuable insights into the virus by examining data related to cases, deaths, vaccines, and percentages across different countries and continents over time. To carry out this analysis, I utilized a range of advanced SQL Query methods, including Join Statements, various functions and formulas, CTE, Temp Tables, and Views. The data for this analysis was obtained from a reputable source, Our World In Data, with the latest dataset being downloaded on 07/20/2021. I performed the analysis between the dates 07/21/2021 and 07/22/2021, with the goal of gaining a deeper understanding of the global impact of COVID-19.</p>

                        <p>As part of my data analysis project, I examined a dataset of over 2000 newspaper articles to identify the main topics covered by each publication. Using Python and advanced Topic Modeling techniques, I was able to extract valuable insights from the data based solely on the newspaper texts. In order to ensure the accuracy of my analysis, I applied three distinct data cleaning approaches, including TF-IDF Normal Cleaning, TF-IDF Frequency Filter, and TF-IDF Nouns and Noun Phrases only. I then utilized powerful LSI and LDA Models to extract the five most useful words from the text, which were then evaluated using a Coherence scoring method to determine the best cleaning method and model. Through my analysis, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the topics covered by each newspaper and identify important trends and insights that could be leveraged for future strategic decision-making.</p>

Additionally, I incorporated explainable AI tools such as LIME and SHAP to help interpret the results and identify key features that contributed to the predictions. Overall, this analysis has significant implications for businesses and organizations looking to better understand the topics and themes prevalent within their data, ultimately enabling them to make more informed decisions and drive better outcomes.</p>

                                <h6>Overview</h6>
                                <p>The article states that more than half of the jobs in the United States are at risk as they potentially can be replaced by Artificial Intelligence. 
                                    Some jobs may be completely eliminated, moving the value of automation to $9 Trillion by the year, 2030. 
                                    Automation will take over repetetive tasks, however human intervention may still be required to some extent, such as communicating daily necessities, etc.</p>
                            
                            
                                <h6>The Industry</h6>
                                <p>The retail industry is rapidly transitioning to a more technologically advanced environment, with self-checkout stations becoming increasingly popular at major retail stores like Publix, Walmart, and Target. These self-checkout stations have replaced some job responsibilities, enabling these companies to reduce their reliance on employees. By shifting their focus towards maintaining and improving these automated systems, companies have been able to cut down on labor costs.
                                    Additionally, with the advent of AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT, the retail industry can take automation and data analysis to the next level. By utilizing chatbots, retailers can streamline communication with their customers, personalize their shopping experience, and make recommendations based on purchasing behavior. Moreover, chatbots can provide support to customers by answering frequently asked questions, which can save time and resources for the company. For instance, 
                                    <ul><p>1. A customer can ask chatbots if a certain product is available in stock, and what isle it can be found at the current store.</p></ul>
                                    <ul><p>2. They can take this a step further and ask chatbots what they would recommend to complement certain foods, for instance, butter complements bread.</p></ul>
                                    <p>This automation can not only help retailers optimize their operations and reduce labor costs, but it can also lead to improved customer satisfaction and sales.</p></p>
                            
                                <h6>The Future</h6>
                                <p>How will automation effect future jobs?</p>
                                <p>There will be a demand of technical skills to some extent. As mentioned above, with the introduction to ChatGPT and other AI tools that provide suggestions and answers on how to write code with additional informtaion, a lot of people can now easily pick up such technical skills. However, there may still be a demand on how to productionize this code and implement it within the company's systems.
                                There also could be changes in the job roles. Some human intervention will still be needed. For instance, going back to the self-checkout stations, employees may now be provided a position to monitor and troubleshoot these stations, rather than perform the cashier tasks.
                                As for the companies, there will be an increase in productivity, since automated systems work faster and if built properly, they may also work efficiently. This means, more sales and revenue for the companies.</p>
